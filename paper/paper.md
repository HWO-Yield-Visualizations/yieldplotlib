# Summary

NASA’s next flagship observatory, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), aims
to detect and charaterize ~25 habitable zone planets. The total number of
habitable zone planets detected is referred to as the exo-Earth "yield" and
accurate yield estimates will be critically important to the mission's success. Tools
like the Altruistic Yield Optimizer (AYO) and EXOSIMS provide these yield
estimates but differ in language, methods, and outputs. `yieldplotlib` provides
a unified library that can visualize the inputs and outputs of these yield
codes in a complete, descriptive, and accessible way.

# Statement of need

To evaluate different designs for HWO [@HWOFeinberg2024], yield codes such as AYO [@AYO2014] and EXOSIMS
[@EXOSIMS2016] calculate the expected exo-Earth yield for each architecture.
While these yield codes have the same goal, their implementations
are so different that validation has become a major obstacle for the community.

Previous efforts have already provided valuable insights. The study @ETCCrossCal2025 compared
the internal exposure time calculations of AYO and EXOSIMS and revealed previously unknown
discrepancies. `yieldplotlib` is a more ambitious continuation of that work.
It is a Python library capable of easily accessing hundreds of important quantities
from both AYO and EXOSIMS.

To visualize the inputs and outputs of AYO and EXOSIMS, `yieldplotlib` uses a custom loading and
parsing structure to easily access equivalent data across both codes.
This allows `yieldplotlib` to communicate the results of yield codes to the broader community
and produce publication-quality plots without manually processing the complex underlying data.
Currently `yieldplotlib` contains modules for analyzing
AYO and EXOSIMS, but can be easily extended to support other yield codes.

# Methods and Functionality

## Parsing and Getting Values

`yieldplotlib` provides a loading system with a unified interface for accessing data from
the yield codes. The system internally manages the complex and inconsistent file structures of the
AYO and EXOSIMS inputs and outputs so that
users can access data with simple and consistent queries.
For collaboration purposes, the valid queries are managed in a Google
Sheet (see \autoref{fig:key_map_csv}) and automatically processed into a universal key map.

## Plotting

### Generic and Comparison Plots

`yieldplotlib` extends the widely used Python plotting library `matplotlib`, leveraging
its extensive customization options and the familiarity many users will already have with it.
The `yieldplotlib` generic
plots (`ypl_plot`, `ypl_scatter`, and `ypl_hist`) are used for single yield run visualizations.

To compare multiple yield runs, `yieldplotlib` also provides a set of flexible comparison plots
that create multi-panel figures to quickly identify discrepancies.

In order to generate summary plots quickly, `yieldplotlib` provides a command line interface
and plotting pipeline to create a suite of commonly used yield plots.

### Plotting Scripts

`yieldplotlib` contains scripts for generating common plots used in yield code visualizations. These
allow users to instantly compare AYO and EXOSIMS results as motivated by the rapid progress of HWO's
architecture trade studies. These scripts also function as examples
for users who want to adapt the generic `yieldplotlib` methods to
generate bespoke visualizations.

\autoref{fig:hz_completeness} compares the mission's "habitable zone completeness", the
probability that the simulated mission's observations would detect a planet in the habitable zone if one exists,
as calculated by the two yield codes side-by-side.
\autoref{fig:planet_hists} shows histograms of the total number of detected
planets found as a function of planet type for the two codes though, in this example, the inputs to each code
also differ resulting in the seen discrepancies.

Solar luminosity) and distance (in parsecs). Here the AYO results are on the left and the EXOSIMS
results are on the right.\label{fig:hz_completeness}](figures/hz_completeness.png)

`yieldplotlib`'s usage of the `mplcyberpunk` color scheme as an alternative
dark mode style. Note that this is a demonstration plot only, the AYO and EXOSIMS
inputs shown are not directly comparable.

Yield code inputs have a profound impact on calculated yield and plotting them
is important to ensure consistency.
Yield input packages (YIPs), a set of files that describe
coronagraph performance, can also be loaded and accessed in `yieldplotlib`
to compare how different codes process the same input coronagraph.
\autoref{fig:core_throughput} shows a comparison of the calculated coronagraph throughput
for both the two codes studied, and as accessed via an additional YIP analysis tool called `yippy`.
Smaller throughputs result in less planet light on the detector
which can result in lower yields.

![Core throughput vs. separation (in $\lambda$/D) for the same coronagraph
when processed by AYO, EXOSIMS, and calculated by a tool named `yippy`.
The differences are due to the different interpolation
methods used and the definition of aperture over which the throughput is calculated. This highlights
the types of insights that tools like `yieldplotlib` can help to uncover.

# Future Work

A new cross-calibration study
of yield codes is being organized and will utilize `yieldplotlib`. This study will be vital to
the ongoing HWO architecture trade studies and ensure more reliable and robust yield estimates.
